# Tao Te Translate
This is just a little clustering of Tao Te Ching translations. What is the Tao
Te Ching you ask? We'll its an ancient book from China that has been translated
many times into English.

I thought I would try parsing some off the web and doing a quick clustering
using sklearn, tf-idf values, and doing dimensionality reduction via Singular
Value Decomposition and t-stochastic neighbor embedding to get some chartable
results. You can view the notebook on nbviewer.

^ I tried to set max rows but for some reason all the cells got maxed out so
you have to scroll a bunch to see anything interesting.
