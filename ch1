The <i>tau</i> (reason) which can be <i>tau</i>-ed (reasoned) is not the Eternal 
<i>Tau</i> (Reason). 
The name which can be named is not the Eternal Name.</p>
<p>Non-existence is named the Antecedent of heaven and earth; and Existence is 
named the Mother of all things. In eternal non-existence, therefore, man seeks 
to pierce the primordial mystery; and, in eternal existence, to behold the 
issues of the Universe. But these two are one and the same, and differ only in 
name.</p>
<p>This sameness (or existence and non-existence) I call the abyss &#151; the abyss of

<p><br>
The TAO, or Principle of Nature, may be discussed [by all]; it is 
not the popular or common Tao.</p>
<p>Its Name may be named [<i>i.e.</i>, the TAO may receive a 
designation, though of itself it has none]; but it is not an ordinary name, [or 
name in the usual sense of the word, for it is a presentment or &#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957; of the 
Infinite].</p>
<p>Its nameless period was that which preceded the birth of the Universe,</p>
<p>In being spoken of by name, it is as the Progenitrix of All Things.</p>
<p>It is therefore in habitual passionlessness [the Quiescent phase of TAO] 
that its mystery may be scanned; and in habitual desire [the Active phase of TAO] 
that its developments may be perceived.</p>
<p>These two conditions, the Active and the Quiescent, alike proceed [from TAO]; 
it is only in name that they differ. Both may be called profundities; and the 
depth of profundity is the gate of every mystery.</p>

(conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things.</p>
<p>Always without desire we must be found,<br>
If its deep mystery we would sound;<br>
But if desire always within us be,<br>
Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.</p>
<p>Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, 
it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the 
Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful.</p>

<p><br>
God (the great everlasting infinite First Cause from whom all things in heaven 
and earth proceed) can neither be defined nor named.</p>
<p>For the God which can be defined or named is but the Creator, the Great Mother 
of all those things of which our senses have cognisance.</p>
<p>Now he who would gain a knowledge of the nature and attributes of the nameless 
and undefinable God, must first set himself free from all earthly desires, for 
unless he can do this, he will be unable to penetrate the material veil which 
interposes between him and those spiritual conditions into which he would obtain 
an insight.</p>
<p>Yet the spiritual and the material, though known to us under different names, 
are similar in origin, and issue from the same source, and the same obscurity 
belongs to both, for deep indeed is the darkness which enshrouds the portals 
through which we have to pass, in order to gain a knowledge of these mysteries.</p>

The Providence which could be indicated by words would not be an all-embracing 
Providence, nor would any name by which we could name it be an ever-applicable

<p>&#147;Non-existence&#148; is a name for the beginning of heaven and earth. &#147;Existence&#148; 
is a name for the genetrix of the innumerable objects of creation.</p>
<p>Hence, &#147;absolute non-existence&#148; suggests to us the miraculous working of what 
in &#147;absolute existence&#148; has become the resulting essence.</p>
<p>These two emanate from the same, though their namings are dissimilar, and

The Principle that can be enunciated is not the one that always was. The being

an ineffable, unnameable being.</p>

become nameable, it gave birth to the multitude of beings.</p>
<p>These two acts are but one, under different denominations. The unique act of 
generation; that is the mystery of the beginning; the mystery of mysteries; the 
door through which have issued, onto the scene of the universe, all of the 
marvels which it contains.</p>

mind. The mind habitually free from passion knows its mysterious essence; the 
habitually passionate mind knows only its effects.</p>

  sea and sky which may be indicated. There is the Heavenly Way leading clear to 
  the clear. Striving to go right ahead right I would tell now of the Heavenly 
  Way.</p>
  <p align="left">What then is this Heavenly Way? What is this Divine which may

  pure power. Through every item of existence while it exists the one pure power 
  will be coming and going on the double wing of the instant. There is a domain 
  that is formal; and a domain numeral; and a domain moral. There may be other 
  domains utterly diverse in the knowing of them. The valid presence of the pure 
  power may be known through all domains. But because of its diversity in mode 
  of manifestation we devise for it many names. Yet ever there is a way of 
  unfoldment in line with the pure power; and in that there may be a return to

realize their Taohood by making close imitations of it. Before one can attain 
the supreme perfection of Taohood, he must first realize its inmost mystery,

<p>There are two ways for effecting this realization, both of which can be followed 
by the human organism. One way to realize the wonderful mystery of TAO is to put 
away all thoughts and desires. The other way is to concentrate both true

Nature can never be completely described, for such a description of Nature would 
have to duplicate Nature.</p>
<p>No name can fully express what it represents.</p>
<p>It is Nature itself, and not any part (or name or description) abstracted from 
Nature, which is the ultimate source of all that happens, all that comes and 
goes, begins and ends, is and is not.</p>
<p>But to describe Nature as &#147;the ultimate source of all&#148; is still only a 
description, and such a description is not Nature itself. Yet since, in order to 
speak of it, we must use words, we shall have to describe it as &#147;the ultimate 
source of all.&#148;</p>
<p>If Nature is inexpressible, he who desires to know Nature as it is in itself 
will not try to express it in words.</p>
<p>To try to express the inexpressible leads one to make distinctions which are 
unreal.</p>
<p>Although the existence of Nature and a description of that existence are two 
different things, yet they are also the same.</p>
<p>For both are ways of existing. That is, a description of existence must have its 
own existence, which is different from the existence of that which it describes;

The way that can be told of is hardly an eternal, absolute, unvarying one;

the name that can be coded and given is no absolute name. <br>
Heaven and earth sprang from something else: the bright nameless; <br>
the named is but the said mother that rears the ten thousand creatures of heaven 
and earth, each after its kind. </p>
<p>He that rids himself of base desire can see the secret essences; <br>
he that didn&#146;t and reached high being, he can see outcomes. <br>
Still the two are the same; the secret and its manifestations came from the same 
ground, the same mould, but anyway sound different — <br>
they&#146;re given different names where they appear. <br>
They can both be called the cosmic mystery, awesome deep <br>
or rather more secret than so-called mystery. </p>
<p>There&#146;s the deeper mystery: the gate and doorway from which issued all secret

The Tao that is spoken of, cannot be truly explained. <br>
The grandest eloquence cannot define it. <br>
It has no name, and is the creator of Heaven and Earth. <br>
Forced to name it, we can call it the Tao (the Way), and accept that it is 
great. <br>
When we are lost in desire we can see only the outer manifestations of this 
greatness. <br>
If we free ourselves from desire we can experience the unfathomable depths, <br>
and know the mystery of the great Tao. <br>
The Mystery and the Manifestations are separate, yet they arise from the same

<p>Therefore let there always be non-being, so we may see their subtlety, and let 
there always be being, so we may see their outcomes. (Chan)</p>
<p>In eternal non-existence, therefore, man seeks to pierce the primordial mystery; 
and, in eternal existence, to behold the issues of the Universe. (Chalmers)</p>
<p>The thought-free awareness, brought about by the mind turned within, lets a 
person behold his true nature &#151; eternal, wondrous, the manifestation of one 
reality.<br>
The awareness that results from the mind turned outward lets a person see his 
life in this world &#151; passing, ordinary, filled with differences.</p>
<p>A mind that is perfectly still and turned inward reflects the pure awareness of 
its boundless nature;<br>
A mind that is restless and turned outward lives in the cage of its own 
thoughts.</p>
